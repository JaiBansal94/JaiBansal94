- 👋 Hi, I’m Jai Bansal
- 👀 I’m interested in learning full stack development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development online through resources such as The Odin Project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything at this point, but I have dipped my toes briefly into the world of ML and AI, with object detection models such as YOLOv4.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email.
